Skins Directory

*The intention of this directory is that it can serve as the central skin repository for all devices utilizing a qml ui as an interface with the linuxMCE system
*The Skins shall ALWAYS be organized by the target platform. If this policy changes, then it will be noted here. Any lack of adherence to this will result in the offending files being removed. I dont like being draconion, but this is for everyone's sanity.
*If your platfor has multiple UX's like android or iOs with phones and tablets, please note these belong  in the corresponding folders for their platform / ux. 
*Desktop UX's are all being kept together and will not be seperated by OS. Tablets and Phones present a different UX issue and thus we take a different approach.

*Your Skin data will need to include:
a qrc file denoting the 'manifest' of qml files in your skin. Please use the existing one for reference only.

Images:
Please only submit the largest size you need, and only once, QML can deal with resizing elements, just make sure they scale gracefully
