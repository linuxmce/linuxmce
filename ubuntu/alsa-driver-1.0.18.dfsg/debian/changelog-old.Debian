alsa-driver (1.0.6a-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - debian/module-blacklist:
      + Add bt878.  Thanks to Reinhard Tartler for the tip.
        (Closes: #279327)
    - debian/rules, debian/alsa-base.(preinst|postinst|postrm|dirs):
      + Put alsa-base.dev in /etc/alsa/dev.d/ and symlink to it
        from /etc/dev.d/snd/controlC[0-3]/alsa-base.dev.  This
        scheme avoids running the script when it isn't needed.
        (Closes: #279405)
    - alsa-base.permissions:
      + Eliminate at the request of the udev maintainer
        (Closes: #279486)
    - alsa-base.dev
      + Take into account the possibility that /usr/ and/or /var/

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - /etc/dev.d/sound/alsa-base.dev
      + Add.  Runs "alsactl restore" after control
        device is created  (Closes: #273090)
    - /etc/udev/permissions.d/alsa-base.permissions
      + Add.  Sets permissions on ALSA snd devices.
    - debian/alsa-base.config
      + Fix quotation bug  (Closes: #278766)
    - debian/control:
      + alsa-headers now Depends on libasound2-dev >= 1.0.6-3.
        This is required in order to guarantee that alsa-headers
        can be removed; older libasound2-dev releases depended on
        alsa-headers.
      + alsa-base now Conflicts with discover1 << 1.7.3 since 
        those versions didn't allow modules to be blacklisted

      + alsa-base now Suggests udev
    - debian/alsa-source.control:

    - debian/control:
      + Tweak descriptions to make it clearer that alsa-base is
        the base package for the ALSA drivers
    - debian/alsa-source.control:
      + Don't Recommend pcmcia packages; only suggest them
  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/module-blacklist:
      + Add dmasound, which has an ALSA replacement: snd-powermac.
        Thanks to Simon Raven for the information.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Oct 2004 00:49:58 +0200

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood
    - asound-debian.h:
      + Eliminate
    - alsa-base.postinst:
      + Use cp insted of cat  (Closes: #273092)
    - debian/rules:
      + Generate discover "skiplist" and hotplug "blacklist" from
        a common "module-blacklist" file
    - module-blacklist:
      + Add the following OSS drivers:
        . ac97_plugin_wm97xx
        . ad1816
        . awe_wave
        . harmony
        . sequencer
        . soundcard
        . via82cxxx

        . dmasound
        . hal2
        . ics2101
        . ite8172
        . msnd
        . nec_vrc5477
        . vidc
        . vwsnd
        . waveartist 
        Please let us know if any of the latter should also be
        added to the blacklist.

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - debian/control:
      + alsa-headers: Don't Depend on libasound2-dev >> 1.0.6-2
        since this makes alsa-lib temporarily unbuildable due to
        libasound2-dev 1.0.6-2 Depending on alsa-headers.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Oct 2004 17:50:35 +0200

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - Remove more XSIisms
    - debian/rules:
      + Fix ownership and perms of installed files  (Closes: #275386)
      + Install alsa-base.discover as /etc/discover.d/alsa-base
        instead of as /usr/share/doc/alsa-base/alsa-base.discover.
        This stops discover1 from loading OSS modules at boot time
        so that ALSA modules can be loaded instead.  This only works
        with discover1 >= 1.7.2.  If you have an earlier version of
        discover1 or if you have discover (version 2) then this
        blacklist file has no effect.
        (Closes: #220616, #265845, #275794, #276272)
    - debian/control:
      + Tweak description
      + Suggest discover1 (>= 1.7.2) which is the first release that
        has the blacklisting feature
    - alsa-base.config:
      + Tweak
    - alsa-base.README.Debian:
      + Update
    - alsa-source.control
      + Tweak description
      + alsa-modules-x.y.z should depend on module-init-tools >= 3.1 so
        that /lib/modules/x.y.z/updates gets magic priority
    - alsa-source.rules
      + Put modules in /lib/modules/x.y.z/updates/alsa/ rather than in
        /lib/modules/x.y.z/alsa/ so that module-init-tools's depmod
        gives them priority over the ones from the kernel.
        (Closes: #261618)
    - alsa-modules.postrm
      + Do depmod -a  (Closes: #276985)
      + Don't run the initscript stop method
  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/control:
      + Make alsa-headers a dummy package for transitional purposes, as
        it's apparently not needed any more.  Packages should use
        libasound2-dev instead.
    - debian/alsa-headers.{dirs,headers}:
      + Remove
    - debian/rules:
      + Remove alsa-headers-related bits

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Oct 2004 18:42:38 +0200

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - Fix up copyright file
    - Add 09_powerpc_build_fixes.dpatch:
      + Patch pmac.patch so that it applies to pmac.c again.
        Fixes build on powermac.  (Closes: #272946)
    - alsa-base.config:
      + Fix failure to configure if alsactl_store_on_shutdown not set
        in /etc/default/alsa.  Thanks to David Mikolajczyk for the
        patch.  (Closes: #273885)

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Sep 2004 21:44:17 +0200

alsa-driver (1.0.6a-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Thomas Hood:
    - alsa-base.postrm
      + purge additional legacy configuration files
    - alsa-base.postinst
      + Delete dangling symlinks in module loader configuration dirs
        (Closes: #265781)

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 2004 20:04:07 +0200

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Fix up patches #4, #9, #10 and #15 to apply cleanly.
    - Rename 'autosave always' to 'always autosave'. Both settings will be
      honoured. (Closes: #269196)
    - Change the default value of alsactl_store_on_shutdown to
      'always autosave'. Also rewrite the comment to list the 3 settings,
      and what the 3 settings do. Also change the postinst to only run 
      alsactl store if the value is 'always autosave'. (Closes: #269214)
    - Honour changes made to /etc/default/alsa in alsa-base's config
      script. (Closes: #261924, #268041)
    - Stop using /var/lib/alsa-base in alsa-modules, and don't create the
      directory in alsa-base. (Closes: #269211)
    - Include a bunch of new cards in alsa-source's debconf prompting:
      + atiixp-modem: PCI: ATI IXP 150/200/250 Modem
      + cs46xx-new-dsp: Cirrus Logic (Sound Fusion) New DSP support
      + emu10k1x: PCI: EMU10K1 (SB Live! or E-mu APS, Dell OEM Version)
      + fm801-tea575x: PCI: ForteMedia FM801 + TEA5757 tuner
      + seq-dummy: Sequencer dummy client
      + sun-amd7930: SPARC: Sun AMD7930

        (Closes: #269494)

      + Send usage to stderr and exit 3 (as per LSB)
      + Use more functions
      + On restart, attempt start even if stop fails
      + On force-reload, start after force-stop
      + Don't pad '...' with spaces (as per policy 9.4)
      + On start, don't fail if attempt to restore mixer levels fails.
        In order to avoid lost races this should be done by the module
        loader (see #268221).  (Closes: #270419)
    - /etc/default/alsa
      + Try to improve comments some more
    - /etc/apm/event.d/alsa
      + Rewrite
      + Remove redundant fuser commands.  Calling the initscript with
        "force-stop" should do everything that is required.
        (Closes: #269282)
    - alsa-base.postinst
      + Clean up
      + Run confmodule at the beginning since it restarts the script

        where people have replaced conf files by symlinks
      + Always use -f option with mv and rm
      + Replace 'autosave always' by 'always autosave'
    - debian/control:
      + Make alsa-base Depend on alsa-utils >= 1.0.6-1
    - debian/po/nl.po:
      + Update, thanks to cobaco  (Closes: #270316)
    - debian/po/da.po:
      + Update, thanks to Morten Brix Pedersen  (Closes: #272510)
    - debian/po/*:

alsa-driver (1.0.5a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Don't kill processes if force_stop_modules_before_suspend is true
      in /etc/default/alsa. (Closes: #266272, #266740, #267257)
    - Reference the correct file in NEWS.Debian. (Closes: #267099)

alsa-driver (1.0.5a-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Remove XSIims in alsa-base's init script. (Closes: #254622)
      (thanks, Clint Adams)
    - Heaven forbid that we actually remove features from the package, so
      reimplement force-stop in the init script, and tell the apm script
      to run force-stop on suspend. Getting modules to load on resume is
      left as an exercise for the user. (Closes: #249541, #253980)
    - Alias force-reload to force-stop. (Closes: #264226)
    - Add audio module to our hotplug blacklist. (Closes: #257635)
    - Automatically load OSS compat modules for sequencers and mixers.
      (Closes: #246570, #258543)
    - 1.0.5a sets CONFIG_SND_CS46XX_NEW_DSP=y. (Closes: #249505)
    - update-modules may spit out warning messages that confuse debconf.
      Redirect stdout to /dev/null when calling update-modules in alsa-base's
      postrm. (Closes: #261853)
    - Fix up now erroneous points from alsa-base's README.Debian.
      (Closes: #248881)
    - Update Dutch Debconf translation. (Closes: #260293) (thanks, cobaco)
    - Update Brazilian Portuguese translation. (Closes: #262601)

alsa-driver (1.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Oops. Only move files in alsa-base's postinst if $filename contains
      something. (Closes: #246064)
    - Run update-modules in the postinst for alsa-base. (Closes: #246311)
    - Debconf translations:
      + Add Turkish. (Closes: #246069) (thanks, Recai Oktas)
      + Update Japanese. (Closes: #246438) (thanks, Kenshi Muto)
      + Update French. (Closes: #246791) (thanks, Christian Perrier)
  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/po/ca.po: Update Catalan translation.
  * David B. Harris:
    - debian/alsa-base.init: Put /usr/local/{sbin,bin} ahead of the
      system-wide versions in $PATH. Thanks to Tollef for noticing this.

 -- Steve Kowalik <stevenk@debian.org>  Sun,  2 May 2004 20:47:19 +1000

alsa-driver (1.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve Kowalik:
    - Actually do some work on this package!
    - Check for the presence of either devfs or udev before creating device 
      nodes in alsa-base's postinst. (Closes: #243876)
    - Rewrite the init script to not load modules. Loading modules is now 
      the responsibility of the user, or hotplug.
      (Closes: #195516, #203491, #210440, #232380, #237003, #237452, #240594)
      (Closes: #244068, #245783)
    - Stop alsa-base depending on lsof and procps.
    - Change the description for alsa-base to no longer mention module
      loading.
    - Rewrite the debconf-age for alsa-base:
      + Stop asking which modules to load. (Closes: #199739, #218655)
      + Only ask one question about saving mixer settings, in the style of
        setserial.
      + This means we can stop doing vile things to the debconf templates in
        debian/rules.
      + This also means that alsa can restore on bootup, and not save on
        shutdown. (Closes: #191501, #232854)
    - Remove the files under /etc/alsa/modutils, and the symlinks
      into /etc/modprobe.d and /etc/modutils.
    - Provide an alsa-base file under /etc/modprobe.d and /etc/modutils 
      which will load the OSS compatibility modules.
      (Closes: #229486, #240594)
    - Blacklist (for hotplug) and skip (for discover) the OSS sound modules.
      Note that we can include the blacklist automatically for hotplug, but
      discover doesn't contain the infrastructure for that, so the file for 
      discover is in /usr/share/doc/alsa-base.
      (Closes: #238278, #238694, #240125, #242720)
    - Due to the fact that the init script no longer touches modules, this
      script has been gutted to a shadow of its former self. (Closes: #238994)
    - Stop using install -d so liberally in debian/rules.
    - Rename debian/po/no.po to debian/po/nb.po.
    - Correct typo in debian/po/fr.po. (Closes: #245031) (thanks,
      Pierre Machard)
    - Remove debian/alsa-path, I can't see anything at all that references it.

  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/po/cs.po: new Czech translation of debconf templates
      (thanks Miroslav Kure <kurem@upcase.inf.upol.cz>; closes: #235644).
    - debian/alsa-modules.postinst: apply patch from Jamin W. Collins to
      avoid unresolved symbols when calling depmod on alsa-modules's
      postinsts (closes: #236543).
    - debian/control: change Maintainer name to "Debian ALSA Maintainers".
    - debian/alsa-base.apm: apply suggestions from Marius Gedminas to
      improve the detection of ALSA devices and the usage of fuser to stop

alsa-driver (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release
  * Jordi Mallach:
    - debian/control, debian/alsa-source.control: sync descriptions with
      alsa-lib's.
  * David B. Harris:
    - Re-disable the GCC version-check warning message, as we already check
      for this in debian/rules. I believe it got lost in the 1.0.2c-1 upload.
      It's just a cosmetic thing, as the logic to actually do the
      version-check was still disabled. (Closes: #234225)
    - Change my Uploaders: email address from my private address to
      dbharris@debian.org
    - debian/alsa-base.init: Produce a more helpful error message when
      'alsactl restore' fails. (Closes: #234233)
    - debian/control (alsa-base): Add version to alsa-utils dependency,
      1.0.2-2, so that the postinst's running of alsactl gets its state from
      the new location (/var/lib/alsa/asound.state)
    - debian/alsa-base.init: Add support to set the
      runlevels within which mixer settings will be saved (the same setting is

  * New upstream release.
  * If you reported a bug against alsa, please test if its working with this
    new version, and give us feedback, either positive or negative. Thanks!
  * debian/scripts/vars: bump TAR_DIR to 0.9.0rc6.
  * debian/modules.d/control.module{,-image}.in: adjust depends for rc6.
  * debian/control: suggest apmd, not apm (closes: #168171).
  * debian/copyright: update package history.
  * debian/init: make it ignore modules called "off" or "null". Patch from
    Michal Cihar <cihar@email.cz>, thanks! (closes: #168842).
  * debian/modules.d/control.module.2.4.19.in: make a copy of the normal
    file, but add conflicts on kernel-image-2.4.19 (<< 2.4.19-3).
  * debian/modules-tools.d/rules: if KVERS = 2.4.19, use the special
    control.module file. Wanted a hack, StevenK? There it is. :)
    (it should really be using debian/modules-tools.d/control.module-image.in,

    --rootcmd. Thanks to Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder for pointing
    me at Brian May's pcmcia-source patch (closes: #161913).
  * debian/rules: remove include/linux/isapnp.h from the current directory,
    not just from the build dir. It wasn't fixed for the alsa-source
    tar.gz... (thanks, Daniel Müller; closes: #164801, really).
  * debian/patches/002_linux_2_2_0_compile_fix: sigh. Looks like this patch
    is obsolete. *Should* fix compiles on 2.2.20. No, I have not tested. I
    can't download 6 different kernels every time I work on this (thanks,
    Shinichi Sakata; closes: #115757, #162378).

    perms for many people (thanks, Daniel Burrows; reopens: #141546).
  * debian/alsa-source.README.debian: add a few extra notes for people
    building module .debs without kernel-package (thanks, Dave Barr;

  * Looks like not everything was broken. Submitter says this is *still*
    working with rc3. We'll see in rc4... (closes: #52564).
  * People, really. The state of this package is still deplorable. We need
    some help with devfs bugs and with alsa-base's init script in general.
    We also need to report all our bugs to ALSA upstreams... I still haven't
    found time to tag them apropiately even, much less to write a list of
    problems to their mailing list. If you think you can help, please contact
    me. I'm willing to continue doing Non-Maintainer ALSA work, but not alone.

  * debian/alsa-source{_VERSION_.config.in,_VERSION_.postinst.in}: remove
    bashisms, use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash.
  * debian/alsa-source.templates: split into lang-independent files (de, ja,

alsadriver (0.3.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed typo in postrm.  Fixes: #40423
  * Changed alsa-base's control information so that it no longer
    'Conflicts' with alsa-modules (in the hope that this might fix bug
    #40795)
  * Fixed alsaconf so as to create the proper lines in /etc/modutils/alsa
    for audiopci1370 and audiopci1371.
  * Added patch to debian/rules from Roberto Lumbreras <rover@debian.org>
    to allow compiling without kernel-package or on a kernel version other
    than the one in /usr/src/linux.

alsadriver (0.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  There must have been something very wrong with
    0.3.1, it seems.
  * Renamed the alsa-modules package to alsa-base.  In a sane and
    reasonable universe, alsa-modules would be the virtual package
    currently known as alsadriver.  This may yet come to pass.
  * Added some "correctness" fixes to the init script. (eliminated useless
    uses of cat, grep, and backslashes).  Also made it use alsactl if
    available, since the new mixer interface requires this.
  * Juggled the dependencies in the hope of making this package a bit
    easier to deal with.

alsadriver (0.3.0-pre4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled ISA PnP support.  Autodetection doesn't work on PnP cards,

  * Moved a period from one side of a single quote to the other (Bug
    #36963)
  * Slightly hacked alsaconfig and /etc/init.d/alsa so they actually work
    (should fix Bug #33605)
  * Fixed several thinkos in debian/rules that resulted in seemingly bogus
    lintian errors.
  * Added dependency on 'make' to the alsa-source package.
  * Updated the alsa web site in copyright.Debian.
  * Now creates /dev/snd symlink in the postinst (Bug #37522, but I'm not
    sure this actually violated policy...)
  * postrm for alsa-modules now behaves correctly.
