Description: ALSA driver configuration files
 This package contains various configuration files for
 the ALSA drivers.
 .
 For ALSA to work on a system with a given sound card,
 there must be an ALSA driver for that card in the kernel.
 Linux 2.6 as shipped in linux-image packages contains
 ALSA drivers for all supported sound cards in the form
 of loadable modules. A custom alsa-modules package can
 be built from the sources in the alsa-source package
 using the m-a utility (included in the module-assistant
 package). Please read the README.Debian file for more
 information about loading and building modules.

Description: ALSA driver sources
 This package contains the source code for the ALSA drivers.
 The source code can be compiled into an alsa-modules package
 using the m-a utility (available in the module-assistant
 package). Please note that the kernel headers must be
 installed to compile these modules. Please read the
 README.Debian file for more information about loading and
 building modules.
