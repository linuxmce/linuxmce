NOTES
~~~~~

* Scripts run by modprobe (because of "install" entries in
  /etc/modprobe.d/*) inherit PATH from whatever runs modprobe.
  Remember that modprobe is run with PATH=/bin:/sbin from
  /etc/init.d/module-init-tools, so such scripts should be careful
  about running commands in /usr/sbin/ and /usr/bin/.

* The way that linux-sound-base "selects" the sound system is now
  entirely consistent.  We are using consequeently udev.

* We considered creating /dev/[snd/]aload(C[0-7]|SEQ) but it was
  decided that this doesn't deliver much benefit.  We have added
  module loader configuration lines that cause the module loader to
  load auxiliary modules on top of card driver modules.  Automatic
  loading in the presence of udev doesn't always work properly.

* If a module loader configuration line for a card driver module is
  added to /etc/mod(utils|probe.d)/alsa-base then the NOPOSTINSTALL
  tag should be added to that module's description in ALSA-card-list
  so that no configuration line will be autogenerated for it.
