Description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin performs a channel scans for digital terrestrial and digital
cable TV and analog ivtv cards, satellite is also supported.


Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install this plugin: unpack it into VDRs Plugin source folder
and compile it as usual.
Replace $VERSION with the actual plugins version like '0.0.1' and
$SOURCEDIR with your path to the sources, usually /usr/src or similar:



cp vdr-wirbelscan-$VERSION.tgz $SOURCEDIR/vdr-1.4.3/PLUGINS
cd $SOURCEDIR/VDR/PLUGINS
tar xfz vdr-wirbelscan-$VERSION.tgz
ln -s wirbelscan-$VERSION wirbelscan
cd $SOURCEDIR/VDR
make plugins


How To Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------
#0 open plugins setup menu page
#1 adjust your country 
#2 define the search in the field 'Source Type'
#3 MAKE SHURE, THAT YOU DONT HAVE TIMERS ON SCHEDULE. Otherwise you may loose them.
#4 Start the scan with the GREEN key and wait. This will take some time, up to 30 min.

After the scanning is done it usually takes some time until you will find
the new channels. This is normal.


Specific Problems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- DVB-T up to now only tested with one card: cinergyT2, may be the search
  algorithm needs some adjustments for other cards. Scan takes < 3min on my VDR.

- DVB-C should work. DVB-C scan will take approx. 30 minutes. 
  You will find additional adjustments here, usually you should leave them on AUTO.

  Hint:
  ----
  For experts this will definitely speed up the scan if symbolrate
  and modulation are set here.
  Nevertheless - with wrong settings some or even all transponders will be lost. 


- Some words of warning and information:

* do NOT scan if you have some recording on your schedule.
  This plugin will steel you the dvb card, regardless wether your recording
  will break.
* the plugin will add new channels - as vdr everytime does - at the end
  of the channels list, so if you have a timer on schedule it may cause
  problems.
