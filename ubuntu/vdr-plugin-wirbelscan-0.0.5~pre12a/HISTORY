- fixed compiler warning in satfrequencies.c and frequencies.c
- setting liveView=true if dvb card used is not free;
  either the only card or receiving/recording. (scanner.c)
- moved "memset(&frontend_status,0, sizeof(frontend_status));"
  into GetStatus(void) (scanner.c) to be shure that
  frontend_status is *always* resetted.
- while scanning now the channels.conf is cleared 
  (and refilled after last scan with the old channel data)
- Added EITScanner.ForceScan(); at the End of dvb scans to
  enshure Adding channels.
- now switching to all new transponders after last scan
- changed transponder scan routines in scanner.c

  tuning to other data; this should enshure that tuning is successful.

- osd: removed inversion setting dvb-c
- osd: added symbolrate setting dvb-c
