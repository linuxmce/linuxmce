Festival Support for Mythphone:

Festival support is currently broken, from what appears to be a bug in festival itself
http://mythtv.org/pipermail/mythtv-dev/2005-February/032326.html

This is not the same problem as the .18.1 package, as myth and speech-tools are both now built with g++-4.

To re-enable festival:
   *Remove the --disable-festival from configure
   *Add libesd0-dev, festival-dev back into build depends
   *Add festvox-don | festival-voice back into the depends for mythphone
