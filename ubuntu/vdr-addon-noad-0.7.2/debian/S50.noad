# noad shutdown hook script - Tobias Grimm <tg@e-tobi.net>
# -------------------------
#
# This script checks if noad is still doing anything, and if so
# advices VDR to try the shutdown again in 5 minutes
#

ps -ae | grep -q noad

if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
  # noad is still running, so we should defer 
  # the shutdown for 5 minutes
  echo "TRY_AGAIN=5"
fi

exit 0
