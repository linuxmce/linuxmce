There are some known issues when compiling the V4L2 Applications.

	- It doesn't check/warn if you don't have all the dependencies:
	  qv4l2 requires qt3 development packages;
	  v4l2-sysfs-path requires libsysfs development packages;

	- qv4l2 doesn't compile with qt4 libraries;

	- make only works fine if called first from /v4l2-apps, since
	  several subdirs require that /v4l2-apps/include to be created,
	  and only the main Makefile forces its creation before building
	  the other files;

	- libv4l doesn't use the in-tree videodev2.h. So, in order to
	  compile, it needs to be installed at /usr/include/linux.

Patches are welcome to improve the building system.
