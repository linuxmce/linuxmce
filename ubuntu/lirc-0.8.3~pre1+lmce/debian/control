Package: lirc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, setserial
Pre-Depends: dialog
Recommends: udev
Suggests: lirc-modules-source, lirc-x
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support
 This package provides the daemons and some utilities to support infra-red
 remote controls under Linux.

Package: lirc-x
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, lirc (= ${source:Version})
Replaces: lirc (<< 0.6.4-8)
Recommends: xfonts-75dpi
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support (X dependent parts)
 This package provides those parts of lirc which depend on the XWindow system.
 .
 Currently:
 .
 irxevent: Allows you to control your X applications with your remote control.
 .
 xmode2: shows the IR waveform of the remote controller without an expensive
 oscilloscope (through an X window). This is not needed for TV cards or the
 Irman.
 .
 You ***MUST*** <--- (really!) have the xfonts-75dpi package available on the
 X server, whether via files or via a font server like xfs. The lirc-x package
 only Recommends: these packages because it's possible to have them served
 remotely, but you really should install them. :)

Package: lirc-modules-source
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, dkms
Recommends: make, dpkg-dev (>= 1.13), gcc | c-compiler, kernel-package
Suggests: kernel-source
Conflicts: lirc (<<0.6.3-1)
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support (kernel modules)
 This package provides the source for the kernel modules to support
 infra-red remote controls under Linux.
 .
 Please note that the kernel sources must be installed to compile these
 modules.
 .
 Also, note that this package is not necessary for usage on Ubuntu since
 the modules are shipped in linux-ubuntu-modules.  It is soley here in
 the case that a local patch needs to be applied.

Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, liblircclient0 (= ${source:Version}), libc6-dev
Description: development files for LIRC client library
 This package contains the static library and headers for
 the LIRC client library.
