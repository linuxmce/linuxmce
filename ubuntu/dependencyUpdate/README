This directory contains simple package definition for creating
packages that are used to fulfill dependencies, when upstream 
packages have changed their name.

The following is a real world example, when Logitech decided
to rename squeezeboxcenter to logitechmediacenter.

In case you need a new one, create a new directory and name it
like the original package is named, plus a version number, for 
example squeezeboxcenter-0.1
Inside squeezeboxcenter-0.1 execute
dh_make -e developers@linuxmce.org --createorig

On the question just select single binary, ignore message regarding
missing Makefile. Edit debian/control and add the dependency for
the newly named package, in our above example logitechmediaserver,
i.e. add a line Depends: logitechmediaserver

After that, run dpkg-buildpackage -tc and a few seconds later you will
have a new deb package.
