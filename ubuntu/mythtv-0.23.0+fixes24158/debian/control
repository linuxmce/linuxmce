 This package will install a complete MythTV client/server environment on a
 single system.  If you are intended on using this as your only MythTV machine,
 and this machine is already configured as a desktop, this package will get you
 up and running switfly.
 .
 If you are intended on installing this on a standalone/non-desktop machine,
 you should look into the metapackages available:
 mythtv-backend-master (backend with a local database)
 mythtv-backend (backend needing a remote database)

 server rather then a desktop. It makes no sense to install it on anything but
 the first backend machine on the network.
