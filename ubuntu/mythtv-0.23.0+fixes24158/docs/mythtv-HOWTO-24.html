<H2><A NAME="advancedpartitionformatting"></A> <A NAME="ss24.1">24.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc24.1">Advanced Partition Formatting </A>
</H2>

<P>The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
optimized for large files.</P>
<P>Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a very
large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large files.
Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner and/or
multi-frontend setups.</P>
<P>There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If deleting
the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may overrun, thereby
resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are faster at deleting files
than others and, for multi-gigabyte MythTV video files, these differences
can be significant.</P>
<P>Fortunately, there are published tests (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>) that provide
insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to MythTV
usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672</A>)
with very large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users
mailing list.</P>

<H3>Ext2</H3>

<P>Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large files.
The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a journaling filesystem,
so a file system consistency check (fsck, which is normally only performed
after a system crash) can take many hours on a filesystem the size of a
typical MythTV partition.</P>

<H3>Ext3</H3>

<P>Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition to be
remounted.</P>
<P>There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This example assumes that <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> has already been created using
<B>fdisk</B>. If you're using LVM, <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> may be something like
<CODE>/dev/VGforMyth/video</CODE>.</P>
<P>The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which can
provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate that
using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the amount of time
required to delete a large file and thus it should only be used with encoder
settings that produce small video files (YMMV).</P>
<P>You can check on your filesystem using the <B>dumpe2fs</B> program. See
the man page for details.</P>
<H3>ReiserFS</H3>

<P>The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient filesystem
and it especially excels at managing partitions containing a large number of
small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the fastest at deleting very
large files.  For that reason, it may not be the best choice when using
encoder bitrates that produce very large files.</P>

<H3>JFS</H3>

<P>JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.  While not
as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat 9 (RH9), Fedora
Core and Mandriva as well as other distros.  According to tests, JFS is the
file deletion speed king, deleting virtually any file in under one second,
even files as large as 10 gigabytes.</P>

<H3>XFS</H3>

<P>XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix, and
later released as open source.  While not a part of the default RedHat Linux
9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of Mandriva and Fedora
Core 2+), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.  XFS provides deletion
speeds for large files only slightly slower than JFS.  According to the test
results shown at (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>), XFS provide
higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may cause
issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS, potentially
leading to dropped frames.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss24.2">24.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc24.2">Caching support for Schedules Direct</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV 0.20.2 or later supports caching of downloaded information from
Schedules Direct, so devices that share a common source do not require
multiple downloads.</P>
<P>Before beginning, perform a backup of your existing database.  See 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-23.html#backupdb">Saving or restoring the database</A> for instructions.</P>
<P>In the following scenario, assume that you have the following:
<OL>
<LI>A PVR-150 MPEG-2 encoder card connected directly to a CATV source.</LI>
<LI>A PVR-250 MPEG-2 encoder card connected via S-Video to a CATV Set Top Box.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>What we are going to do is to create a single lineup at Schedules Direct and
then create two Video Sources which use the same login information but have
different channels associated with them.</P>
<P>On your Schedules Direct account, create a lineup that has all of the
channels that you can receive.  Because we have a Set Top Box (STB), choose
a Digital lineup.  Yes, this means that you may have 900 channels in this
lineup, but that's OK.</P>
<P>Use the Schedules Direct channel editor and unselect any channels that you
can't tune without the STB.  This will usually be channels higher than 125,
but check your CATV provider lineup if you're not sure.  Once you've
deselected them (using a click on the first channel you can't receive and
then a shift-click on the last channel you can't receive will deselect all
the channels in between those two.) click the Save Changes button at the
bottom of the screen.</P>
<P>In <B>mythtv-setup</B>, create a Video Source with an appropriate name.
"SD-Analog Only" will be used in this example.  Click "Retrieve Lineups"
and select the digital lineup you just created at Schedules Direct.</P>
<P>Click "Finish" to return to the Video sources selector and then press the
ESC key to go back to the main screen.</P>
<P>Now choose Input Connections.  Select the PVR-150 which is connected
directly to the CATV.  Set the Video Source to "SD-Analog Only" and click
"Fetch channels from listings source".</P>
<P>Set the start channel to an appropriate value.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  There is a bug where the "Fetch" command may not work; you
can tell that the Fetch did not retrieve any channels in one of two ways: in
the text-mode console, you will see a connection to Schedules Direct, but it
doesn't appear to retrieve any channel information:

</P>
<P>Repeat the Input Connection configuration for any other capture devices that
are connected directly to the CATV system.  You do not need to click Fetch
once you've done one successful download of the channel information - the
Starting channel should be automatically populated.</P>
<P>Go back to Schedules Direct and re-enable the channels that you had
previously deselected, then click Save Changes.</P>
<P>Create a new Video Source, here called "SD-All Digital Channels".  Perform
the same "Retrieve Listings" you did before.</P>
<P>Go back to the Input Connections screen, select the PVR-250 which is
connected to the STB, assign the "SD-All Digital Channels" video source and
perform a retrieve channels.  This will pull down the complete channel
listing, but only for <EM>this</EM> device.</P>
<P>When <B>mythfilldatabase</B> runs, it will cache the "big" download which
is appropriate for the STB, and then copy the information to the channels
that can only be accessed without the STB.  But by default
<B>mythfilldatabase</B> is going to notice that the "Analog only" video
source is missing the channels that are in the Digital lineup you created at
Schedules Direct, so we need to override the addition of new channels.</P>
<P>When you run <B>mythfilldatabase</B> to populate your database, you'll
need to run it like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythfilldatabase --remove-new-channels
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will also need to modify how the <B>mythbackend</B> calls
<B>mythfilldatabase</B> when it performs its automatic listings update.</P>
<P>In <B>mythfrontend</B>, select "Setup" -> "General".</P>
<P>Continue press ENTER until you reach the Mythfilldatabase configuration
screen.  In the "mythfilldatabase Arguments" field, type
--remove-new-channels</P>
<P>then press the TAB key until you reach Finish, then press ENTER to save.
You can then press ESC until you return to the main screen.</P>
