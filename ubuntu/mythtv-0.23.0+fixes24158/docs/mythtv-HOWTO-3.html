<P>You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the ports
that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the "inside" LAN.
The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend (TCP ports 6543 and
6544) must be open.  It is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended that you do
<EM>not</EM> expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or your
"Outside" LAN.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.</P>
<P>For a good MythTV experience, you must understand that MythTV exercises your
hardware more than a typical desktop. Encoder cards generate DMA across the
PCI bus.  The CPU is busy encoding / decoding video. Hard drives are
constantly reading and writing data. Building a MythTV system on older /
"spare" hardware may be an exercise in frustration and can waste many hours
of valuable time.</P>
<P>If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list at
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/</A> or
post a question to the list.</P>
<H3>CPU Type and Speed</H3>

<P>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.</P>
<P>MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software
video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video
capture card to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your
motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and
devices like the TiVo and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use
specialized hardware to convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format
without using the motherboard CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of
running the Operating System and reading and writing the encoded frames to
the disk.  These tasks have fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding
video, which is why a device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of
RAM and a 54MHz CPU.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder if you are doing software-based encoding, less if you are using a
hardware-based encoder.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
<LI>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, in which case MythTV will primarily be I/O bound.  There are
several examples of such devices, like the Hauppauge
WinTV-PVR-150/250/350/500 series, the Hauppauge HD-PVR, or the Silicon Dust
HDHomerun.  In this mode, because the video encoding is being done by a
dedicated video processor (the Hauppauges), or the device is simply writing
the data to disk (the HDHR and other digital devices, such as DVB cards) the
host CPU requirements are quite low.  See the 
<A HREF="#video_capture_device">Video Capture Device</A> section for details.</P>
<P>Primary development in MythTV has transitioned to supporting MPEG-2 capture
devices and HDTV, so if given the option, go with the hardware MPEG-2
encoder or ATSC.  Because of the transition to digital broadcast in
the United States, most television stations are now digital-only.  There are
still analog stations in the U.S., but a majority are low-powered.  Canada
still has analog broadcasts.  </P>
<P>Analog encoding or hardware MPEG-2 encoding may still be required if you are
trying to capture standard definition video sources, such as set-top-boxes.</P>

<H3>Memory</H3>

<P>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 512MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 512MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.</P>

<H3>Hard Disk(s)</H3>

<P>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour for
MPEG-4, 2 GB/hour for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg and 7 GB/hour for ATSC HDTV.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot time.
See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.</P>
<P>See the Troubleshooting 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#Setting_DMA">section</A> for more
information.</P>

<H3>Filesystems</H3>

<P>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 4GB.  You <EM>must</EM>
use a 64 or 128 bit filesystem. These will allow you to create large files.
Filesystems known to have problems with large files are FAT (all versions),
and ReiserFS (versions 3 and 4).</P>
<P>Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well at
deleting them is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that XFS and JFS do
very well at this task.  You are <EM>strongly</EM> encouraged to consider
one of these for your MythTV filesystem.  JFS is the absolute best at
deletion, so you may want to try it if XFS gives you problems.  MythTV
incorporates a "slow delete" feature, which progressively shrinks the file
rather than attempting to delete it all at once, so if you're more
comfortable with a filesystem such as ext3 (whose delete performance for
large files isn't that good) you may use it rather than one of the
known-good high-performance file systems.  There are other ramifications to
using XFS and JFS - neither offer the opportunity to shrink a filesystem;
they may only be expanded.</P>
<P>

<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must not</EM> use ReiserFS v3 for
your recordings. You will get corrupted recordings if you do.</CAPTION>

</P>
<P>Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for future
expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power supply have the
capacity for additional hard drives, read through the

<A NAME="video_capture_device"></A> </P>
<H3>Video Capture Device</H3>

<P>In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
available for capturing video.</P>
<H3>Frame Grabbers.</H3>

<P>This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There is no
on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a Digital-Analog
Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the computer in an
essentially raw digital form.</P>
<P>For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</CODE> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (
<A HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list</A>) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.</P>
<P>The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848, Bt878 or CX2388x
series of video capture chips; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and
the "AverTV Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.</P>

<H3>Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.</H3>

<P>While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-based
encoding.  Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a MPEG-2 encoder card
supported by the IvyTV project 
<A HREF="http://ivtvdriver.org/">http://ivtvdriver.org</A> such as the Hauppauge PVR-150/250/350/500,
Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan M600 cards will allow you to
use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your CPU.  Using the on-board
MPEG-2 encoder greatly reduces the CPU requirements for encoding.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Motherboards with the Via chipset are notoriously bad with
DMA and have caused numerous issues with ivtv, including hard locks.  See
the ivtv website 
<A HREF="http://ivtvdriver.org">http://ivtvdriver.org</A>
for the latest information on what works and what doesn't.</P>

<H3>DVB capture cards.</H3>

<P>DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe (where it comes in
DVB-C, DVB-T and DVB-S varieties for Cable, Terrestrial and Satellite) and
is also used as the programming interface for HDTV capture cards in Linux.
To see if your DVB card is supported, see the list of cards in the
"Supported Hardware" section of the DVB Wiki at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</A> for more
information.</P>
<P>In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.lyngsat.com/">http://www.lyngsat.com/</A> for the types
of content which is available.</P>

<H3>HDTV.</H3>

<P>There are a number of HDTV cards with Linux drivers which are known to
operate in the United States; a complete list of cards with DVB drivers can
be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/">http://www.linuxtv.org/</A> Some cards support
capture of unencrypted digital cable TV (utilizing QAM256), others will only
work with Over The Air signals captured with an antenna (with 8VSB).</P>
<P><EM>None</EM> of the capture devices listed above
perform any encoding; they merely allow your computer to save a copy of a
HDTV stream which has already been converted to MPEG-2 at the broadcast
facility.</P>

<H3>Hauppauge HD PVR</H3>

<P>Hauppuage makes a device called the HD PVR, which accepts component HDTV
signals and TOSLINK / SPDIF audio and performs a real-time encode into
H.264.  See 
<A HREF="http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html">http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html</A> for
additional information.</P>

<H3>Playback of HDTV using CPU</H3>

<P>To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU if your video card does not
provide support for offloading video decode. (See below for a description of VDPAU)</P>
<P>"How powerful?" depends on a number of factors, such as the capture
resolution, whether the video is progressive or interlaced, and whether your
display card has hardware-assist support for Linux.</P>
<P>The Simple Answer: Once you are in the 3.2 Ghz P4-class of CPU you should have
no issues with viewing HDTV.</P>
<P>The Complicated Answer:</P>
<P>For 720p content (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be sufficient.</P>
<P>For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods done in
real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob and Weave"
deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with video decode acceleration. </P>

<H3>Playback of HDTV using VDPAU</H3>

<P>NVIDIA now incorporates MPEG-2 and H.264 decode acceleration in their
binary driver; this is now officially supported in MythTV 0.22.  Use of
VDPAU offloads the decompression and deinterlacing of video to the video GPU
rather than the CPU of the frontend, so the CPU requirements are drastically
lowered.  A fanless frontend using an Intel Atom CPU running a single-core at
1.6Ghz is sufficient to decode and deinterlace MPEG-2 and H.264.</P>

<H3>Firewire.</H3>

<P>You may use the Firewire output of the Motorola DCT6200 or the SA3250.
If your provider uses 5C encryption on a particular channel, you won't be
able to get any content.</P>

<H3>DBoxII or other devices running Neutrino</H3>

<P>You may use the Ethernet port of an DBoxII or a similar device to capture
MPEG-2. Your set top box has to be running the Neutrino GUI.</P>

<H3>USB Capture Devices.</H3>

<P>The Plextor ConvertX PVR devices are supported through Linux drivers
available from 
<A HREF="http://go7007.imploder.org/">http://go7007.imploder.org/</A>.  MythTV uses the Plextor to capture
hardware encoded MPEG-4, so the host CPU requirements are low.</P>
<P>Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-USB2 and variants are supported by the Linux Kernel as
of 2.6.18.  Additional information is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/">http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/</A>).</P>

<H3>IP Recorder (RTSP, RTS, UDP)</H3>

<P>MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and H.264 stream recording is supported using the IPTV
recorder in MythTV.  This recorder expects the channels to be supplied as a
m3u playlist.  If your DSL/Fiber provider supplies television service, but
does not provide a m3u playlist for the channels, you can construct one for
your own use.  You do not need to download it from the same server as the
streams themselves, and it can also be read from a file if this is more
convenient.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Some DSL providers only allow you to use one recorder at a
time, so you may need to limit yourself to one recorder in MythTV and turn
off any set top box the cable provider sold or rented to you with your
service. This limitation is independent of the bandwidth you have purchased.</P>

<H3>Sound card</H3>

<P>The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in some cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Analog video capture cards are the only ones which
require a sound card for capturing audio.  DVB, HDTV, and other hardware
encoder cards all provide a combined audio / video stream.  If you're not
using a V4L analog device, you may skip this section.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video is to
run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to the Line input
on a sound card. However, some video capture cards provide on-board audio
capabilities that work with the kernel <CODE>btaudio</CODE> module instead,
thereby eliminating the need for a cable.  This is useful if you will be
using multiple capture cards in a single chassis, since each capture card
will not need its own sound card.  Note that a separate sound card is still
required for playback when using <CODE>btaudio</CODE>, and that often the audio
recorded in this way will be mono only.  See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-23.html#btaudio">btaudio</A> section for more information.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Plugging a Line-level device into the Mic input is
not recommended.  Line-level devices have higher voltages and can damage the
sound card.  In addition, even if it doesn't break your card, you will be
getting Mono sound.  See the Linux MP3 HOWTO at 
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-HOWTO.html</A> for additional information.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>

<H3>Video Display Card</H3>

<P>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the X documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <CODE>xvinfo</CODE>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.</P>

<P>If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can either be
a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that converts the
VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate" depends on a number
of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs. PAL), the type of input
connection (Composite vs. SVideo), etc.</P>
<P>Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.</P>

<H3>Cards with TV-out</H3>

<P>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is
organized by manufacturer.</P>
<P>Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details, please
search the archives at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/</A> using
the card name in your search string.</P>

<H3>ATI</H3>

<P>ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but only offers Linux
drivers for Radeon 8500 and above cards.  See the Drivers and Software
section of 
<A HREF="http://www.ati.com/">http://www.ati.com</A> for the
driver and additional information.</P>
<P>The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">http://gatos.sourceforge.net</A>
project offers some support for TV-out on other ATI cards, but only in its
"experimental" version, available through CVS. There have been reports from
people who say they have made this driver work with one or another ATI card.
For example, Bruce Markey 
<A HREF="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com">mailto:bjm@lvcm.com</A> writes (on the
mythtv-users mailing list): "I got this to work. You can quote me on that.
I've used TV-out on several models of ATI cards both All-In-Wonder and
regular cards with TV-out." See the "Adventurous Setup" section of 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php">http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php</A> for details. Also see
<A HREF="http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html">http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html</A> for more information.</P>

<H3>NVIDIA</H3>

<P>Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver in
X, combined with the userspace application <B>nvtv</B> to control the TV-out
port. See 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/</A> for details.  Recent
versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and other
features useful with TV-Out, so the <B>nvtv</B> application may not be
required.</P>
<P>Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
available by NVIDIA. See 
<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html">http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html</A> for more information.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  It's strongly recommended that you use the proprietary
NVIDIA drivers; they have excellent support for XvMC and ship with a good
configuration utility.  XvMC provides MPEG-2 hardware acceleration, which is
important if you want to display HDTV.  VDPAU is another new feature and it
provides an API for offloading MPEG-2 and H.264 to the GPU.</P>


<H3><A NAME="PVR-350"></A> Hauppauge PVR-350 </H3>

<P>As of MythTV 0.22, the  TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions of the
PVR-350 are no longer supported.  This functionality is currently
unmaintained, and will be removed in MythTV 0.23.</P>

<H3>External Adapters</H3>

<P>External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for
display on a television. The output format varies by region, since
different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-users

<H3><A NAME="atrpms"></A> Red Hat Linux / Fedora Core / MythDora </H3>

<P>The definitive documentation on installing MythTV on Red Hat Linux /
Fedora Core can be found in Jarod Wilson's (
<A HREF="mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com">mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com</A>) HOWTO at 
<A HREF="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/">http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/</A> Just
like 3rd-party packages, any 3rd-party documentation problems should be
brought up with the 3rd-parties (maintainer, lists, bugzillas etc.).  The
installation instructions which follow should be used as a guide only; refer
to Jarod's guide.</P>
<P>Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core packages for MythTV and all of its add-on
modules and some themes have been packaged by 
<A HREF="mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net">mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net</A> and
are available at 
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/">http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/</A>. All of the prerequisites for
MythTV (such as XMLTV) are available as RPM packages. If you have problems
with the RPMs, please contact the ATrpms lists at 
<A HREF="http://lists.ATrpms.net/">http://lists.ATrpms.net/</A> or file a
bug against 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/">http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/</A>.</P>
<P>Given the large number of dependent RPMs you are advised to use tools like
apt or yum for automatic retrieval and installation of the required RPMs.
(
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/install.html">http://ATrpms.net/install.html</A>) In this case a
special meta-package called mythtv-suite will allow you to install all of
MythTV and its add-ons, plus all dependencies.</P>
<P>If you don't have <B>apt</B> or <B>yum</B> on your machine, download and
install the atrpms-kickstart package from 
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/">http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/</A>.
Install the package with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uvh atrpms-kickstart*
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# apt-get update
# apt-get dist-upgrade
# apt-get update
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

And finally:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# apt-get install mythtv-suite
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

These steps however, do NOT perform the installation of any drivers required
for <B>ALSA</B>, capture cards, <B>lirc kernel modules</B>, etc., nor do
they set up your MythTV database. Check 
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/">http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/</A> for the drivers you
need.</P>

<H3>Debian</H3>

<P>Debian packages for MythTV and most of its add-on modules are maintained
by Christian Marillat 
<A HREF="mailto:marillat@free.fr">mailto:marillat@free.fr</A> and are available at 
<A HREF="http://www.debian-multimedia.org/">http://www.debian-multimedia.org/</A>.
Installation instructions can be found on those pages as well. All of the
prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages, most of them from
the official Debian archive.</P>
<P>After adding the appropriate commands to your <CODE>/etc/apt/sources.list</CODE>
file you can run <B>apt-get update</B> and then execute <B>apt-get
build-dep mythtv</B> which should install all the pre-requisites required
to compile MythTV.</P>

<H3>Manual installation</H3>

<P>You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you
can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it
all depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P>In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  This list includes <B>mysql</B>, <B>gcc</B>,
<B>freetype2-devel</B>, <B>xorg-xserver-devel</B>, <B>qt-devel</B> and
<B>lame</B>.  If you're going to use a remote control with MythTV, you're
going to need the <B>cdialog</B> package in order to compile
<B>lircd</B> if your distribution doesn't have a pre-packaged
<B>lirc</B>.  If you are using <B>XMLTV</B> as a grabber, you will need
<B>perl</B>.</P>

<PRE>
NOTE:  Qt v4.4 or higher is required.

NOTE:  If you are going to be using packages to install various
components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
headers for compiling.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.
