This is a collection of files for various distributions.  Most/all of these
scripts are intended to work with the init.d (sometimes called SysV) or other
similar systems used by the various distributions.

The "init" files should usually go into /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d/, but
you should check to make sure that is the correct path for your chosen
distribution.

The "sysconfig" files should go into /etc/sysconfig/, with the same caveat.

They should both be renamed to remove any header information.  E.g.

    fedora.init.mythbackend  ->  /etc/init.d/mythbackend

The "upstart" files should go in /etc/init/ and a symlink referencing the
upstart-job binary should be created in /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d/.

    upstart.mythtv-backend.conf -> /etc/init/mythtv-backend.conf
    ln -s /lib/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/mythtv-backend
