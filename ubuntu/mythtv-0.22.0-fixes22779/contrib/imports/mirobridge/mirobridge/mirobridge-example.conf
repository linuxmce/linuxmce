# This config file contains settings will change the default behavior of mirobridge.py
# Copy this example file to the PC on which you will be running mirobridge.py and place into the 
# directory "/.../.../.mythtv" and rename it to "mirobridge.conf". Mirobridge will automatically 
# use the file if it exists. For most users the directory will be located at "~/.mythtv"

# START  icon_override section ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Normally the Miro Channel icon is used as cover art in MythVideo but sometimes the Miro video's icon
# is better. Specifically movie trailers fall into this category as the icons with some feeds items 
# are the movie's poster. To override the default and have mirobridge use the item's icon you 
# need to have the Miro channel name specified. See the example "Timo's HD Movie Trailers" below. To 
# activate the Timo example remove the leading '#' sign. To add more channels the format is always 
# channel title as specified in Miro (or what you renamed it to in Miro) ending with a ':'
# Each Channel requires its own line, you cannot have multiple Channels per line.
# NOTE: It is only rarely that you want to use this feature as in most cases the the Miro video's icon
#       is a video screenshot and makes for a very poor coverart.
# NOTE: This only effects the Miro videos in MythVideo the "Watch Recordings" screen will always use
#       the channel icon as it's cover art.
# NOTE: Do not surround any Channel name with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the Channel name "Timo's HD Movie Trailers" is expressed as value: Timo's HD Movie Trailers

# START  Watch-then-copy section ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The default action is that all Miro videos that have been marked as Watched within MythTV are
# moved to MythVideo and only removed after the expiry date specified in Miro (x number of days).
# With some of the channels you may want to keep the videos after they are watch from the MythTV
# "Watch Recordings" screen. Any Channel identified in this section once downloaded through Miro
# will become visible in MythTV's Watch Recordinings screen. Once the video is watched it will be
# physically copied from Miro into the specified MythVideo directory. This includes any icons and
# screenshots, with the metadata being added to the MythVideo data base table "videometadata".
# Once successfully copied the video it will be removed from Miro and the Miro video directory.
# The specific advantage of the "watch-then-copy" method over "mythvideo_only" configuration 
# seen in the next section, is that the Watch Recording screen acts as a place you can quickly 
# identify any newly downloaded videos. You do not have to manually check "what's new" 
# in a MythVideo directory that may have many existing videos.
# If you want ALL Miro Channels use the "watch-then-copy" method then use the (-N) command line
# option OR the channel name "all miro channels". Any other channel names in this section will be
# ignored. With the command line (-N) option all files will be copied into the Miro subdirectory of
# MythVideo.
# To activate the "Timo's" example remove the leading '#' sign. 
# To add more channels the format is always channel title and a ":" then the directory to 
# copy the file into.
# All copied files will be renamed to the format "channel title - item title" 
# (e.g. "Linux Journal - More on kill and pkill")
# Each Channel requires its own line, you cannot have multiple Channels per line.
# NOTE: Do not surround any Channel name or directory path with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the Channel name "/media/video/Timo trailers" is expressed 
#            as value: /media/video/Timo trailers
# NOTE: By default a subdirectory with the Channel's name will be created. 
#       In the "Timo" example below a video would be copied to the directory path
#       "/media/video/trailers/Timo's HD Movie Trailers"
#       This behavior can be suppressed with the mirobridge.py command line option "-o".

# The default action is that all newly downloaded Miro videos are added to the

# directly to MythVideo. Once copied the video will be deleted from Miro. To specify that one or 
# more Miro Channels which get copied directly to MythVideo add the channel title and a ":" then the 
# directory to copy the file into. The target directory must be within the directory structure 
# of MythVideo. Any subdirectories above the MythVideo base path will be created if they do 
# not exist. 
# If you want ALL Miro Channels to go directly to MythVideo then use the (-M) command line

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CURRENTLY THE FEATURES IN THIS SECTION HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# By default mirobridge exclusively uses the Miro meta data and graphics (Channel icon or 
# video icon and video screenshot), when adding a Miro video to either MythTV and MythVideo. 
# In a very few instances there may be graphics (Posters, Banners and/or Fan art) that are available
# and relevant to a Miro video. These instances consist of Movie Trailers and video casts for TV shows.
# In these cases better quality graphica may be available from either themoviedb.com or thetvdb.com
# In this section:
#     For TV shows you can specify a Channel name and thetvdb.com reference number. The TV series "Nova"
#     "Nature" examples have been provided. 
#     For movies just the Channel name is required.
#
# When a Channel has been specified in either the Movie or TV sections mirobridge will check the
# relevant source (themoviedb.com or thetvdb.com) for better graphics. If found they will be downloaded
# and used in place of the lower quality Miro graphics. 
# To utilize this feature the script Jamu must be installed and functioning independantly of 
# mirobridge. All of the mirobridge provided python scripts (*.py) must be installed in the same
# directory as Jamu is installed. See this wiki page on Jamu download and installation instructions.
# You do not have to use Jamu for the functinality described on the wiki page as mirobridge utilizes
# Jamu's functionality specifically to access themoviedb.com and thetvdb.com web site for graphics.
# Jamu wiki page: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Jamu
#
# The examples below are already activated. The Channel names MUST be exactly as you have specified in
# your Miro configuration. These examples may not match the Channel names in your Miro configuration.
# For Movie trailers there will be a maximum of two attempts to find the correct movie. 
# The first attempt will assume that the movie is to be released in the current year. If there is no 
# match the second attempt will assume the movie will be released in the coming year. 
#
# To add more channels the format is always channel title then a ":"
# Each Channel requires its own line, you cannot have multiple Channels per line.
# NOTE: Do not surround any Channel name with quotes even if it contains spaces.
#       e.g. the Channel name "Onion News Network" is expressed as value: Onion News Network
# NOTE: If you use the options to move all Miro videos directly to MythVideo the "watch_only" is 
#       irrelevant and will not have any effect on mirobridge.py processing.
