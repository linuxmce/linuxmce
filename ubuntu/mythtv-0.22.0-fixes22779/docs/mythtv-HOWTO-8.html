<P>MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <B>lirc</B>, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program. 
<B>lirc</B> handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which
then acts as if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The file
<CODE>keys.txt</CODE> describes the keys used to control MythTV.</P>
<P>Compilation of lirc is outside the scope of this document.</P>
<P>You can dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an IR keyboard and a
learning remote control.  The IR keyboard receiver plugs into your PC and
you would train your learning remote to emulate the various keystrokes from
<CODE>keys.txt</CODE> of your IR keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc
entirely from the picture - your remote will be sending keypresses that your
PC "sees" on the keyboard port.</P>
<P>The "Big Picture" for lirc is that there are a few different things that fit
together.</P>
<P>First, lirc has a portion which is connected to an IR receiver.  The IR
receiver senses the pulses and sends them to the lirc daemon.  The lircd
loads a file called <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> which instructs it how interpret the
IR pulses that it received and convert them to a human-readable name.</P>
<P>For example, the hardware may receive pulses may correlate to "Channel Up". 
The <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file will then contain a line that looks something
like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ChannelUp                0x0000000000001020
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file can have multiple remote controls defined.</P>
<P>The second part is <CODE>lircrc</CODE>, which takes the name of the button which
was pressed ("ChannelUp") in the above example, and associates that to an
action to be performed by a program using the remote control.  So in MythTV,
ChannelUp means one thing, while in <B>mplayer</B> it means something
different.  <CODE>lircrc</CODE> gives you the flexibility of taking the name of
the button and having it perform different actions depending on which
program you're using at the time.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  The definitions in <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> come from the user
community, and there is no standard for the common button names.  One
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file may contain a definition for a button called
"ChannelUp", while another may contain a definition for "Chan+".  Your
<CODE>lircrc</CODE> file must therefore be configured appropriately, or it won't
work.</P>
<P>Look for pre-made lircd.conf configuration files at 
<A HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/">http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/</A>.  If you find one of your remotes
either on the website or on your system, download or copy the file,
name it <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> and put it in your <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory.  If
you couldn't find your remote, you must make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE>
file.</P>
<P>To make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irrecord myremote
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys. If
your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting your
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>now try to start lircd again:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR signals. If
everything went well, the install script for lircd put an appropriate
configuration file for your remote into <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> This file
maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from the
receiver.</P>
<P>The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be used
to control MythTV.  MythTV now includes native support for lirc and can
interact directly with it.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd mythtv/contrib/config_files/lirc
$ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

$ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
native lirc support by enabling it in <B>configure</B> or you
need to run the <B>irxevent</B> program, which takes the key presses and
sends them to MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
<B>irxevent</B>.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run
it like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
control unless you're using native lirc support.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Additional information for lirc</A>
</H2>

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>contrib/configfiles/</CODE>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file that came with MythTV.</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file has this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

but the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> that comes in the lircd package
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>contrib/config_files/lirc/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>
remote defines the button names.</P>
<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.</P>
<P>Note the <B>repeat =</B> parameter.  This informs the <CODE>irxevent</CODE>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <CODE>lirc</CODE>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <B>repeat =</B> number will vary from system to
system, so experiment and see which value works best for you.</P>
