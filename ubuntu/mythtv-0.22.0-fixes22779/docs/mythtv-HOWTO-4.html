<P>Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from
<B>subversion</B>, you may need to modify your system configuration in a
few ways.</P>
<P>In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your Linux
distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about the issues in
this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the packages should take
care of them. However, this section is still recommended reading which may
help if the packager skipped a step in their packaging.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc4.1">Software requirements for compiling MythTV</A>
</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<P>MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard,
compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, <CODE>make</CODE>, and
appropriate header files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux
distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation environment
from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO provides some details
of how to install the required environment for many distributions.</P>
<P>Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you may
have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.</P>
<P>The reference compilation system for MythTV is Ubuntu.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc4.2">Shared-Library requirements for MythTV</A>
</H2>

<H3><A NAME="modifying_ld.so.conf"></A> Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf </H3>

<P>The runtime manager for shared libraries, <B>/lib/ld.so</B>, gets
information about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.cache</CODE>, a file created by <B>ldconfig</B> from
information in <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>.  Because MythTV installs 
shared libraries in <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>, that directory needs to be
added to the list of directories for <B>ld.so</B> to search when doing
runtime linking of programs, if it is not already there.  You do this, as
root, by editing <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>, then running <B>ldconfig</B>. 
There are many ways to do this; to determine the way that your distribution
is configured, type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you see that your .conf file consists of just the "include" line, then
execute the following as root:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ sudo bash
# echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mythtv.conf
# /sbin/ldconfig
# exit
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If your .conf file has many individual entries in it, then type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ sudo bash
# echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# /sbin/ldconfig
# exit
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<H3>QT libraries and binaries</H3>

<P>The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory holding the
QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your distribution may already
be making these changes as a part of the installation of the software
prerequisites detailed earlier.</P>
<P>One way to do this is as follows: 
<A NAME="Checking_that_it_worked"></A> </P>
<P>Open a shell and execute the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt4/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:
$ echo $QTDIR
/usr/lib/qt4
$ which qmake
/usr/bin/qmake
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you don't see values like those above, do not proceed past this step
until you have resolved this error.  You may need to manually specify the
QTDIR and PATH at the shell prompt before compiling.</P>
<P>Also, check that there has been a link created in
<CODE>/usr/lib/qt4/mkspecs</CODE> called <CODE>default</CODE>.  If not, you'll get
errors during the compile.  See the Troubleshooting Section for more
information.</P>
