vdr (1.4.7-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The script /usr/lib/vdr/vdr-groups.sh may now be used by plugins to
  manage the group memberships of the user 'vdr'. See README.Debian
  for details on how to use this script.
  
  If you manually need to add the user 'vdr' to a group, you should
  add the group name to /etc/vdr/vdr-groups. This way the vdr-groups.sh
  script used by plugin installation/deinstallation procedures does
  not try to remove vdr from this group.

vdr (1.2.6-9) experimental; urgency=low

  This release adds a patch which allows us to have just one binary-
  package for all four control-methods, so we do not need the 
  packages vdr-daemon, vdr-kbd, vdr-lirc and vdr-rcu anymore. 
  You can run vdr with the control-method you want by calling 
  /usr/bin/vdr-{daemon,kbd,lirc,rcu} or by using 
  
  update-alternatives --config vdr

  and setting it to the desired control-method. (lirc is default)
  After this a call of /usr/bin/vdr will always use the control-
  method you selected with update-alternatives.

vdr (1.2.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  The most important change in this release is that vdr from now on
  will run under the username vdr, not as root. This is due to some
  security problems when vdr runs as root. The video-directory and 
  configfiles will be changed at installation, so they are owned by 
  the user and group vdr.

  The second thing is that the automatic shutdown of vdr is now disabled
  by default, you can enable it again by changing ENABLE_SHUTDOWN to 1 
  in /etc/default/vdr.
  
  In this release we also changed the default VIDEO_DIR from 
  /var/lib/video to /var/lib/video.00, to make adding extra harddisks 
  for vdr very easy by just creating /var/lib/video.0{1,2,3,...} and 
  mounting the drive(s) there. In existing installations we will simply 
  create a symlink /var/lib/video.00 which points to /var/lib/video. In 
  new installations /var/lib/video will be a symlink which points to 
  /var/lib/video.00. (These changes will only be asked for when you 
  selected yes in the debconf-question to create the video-directory!)

vdr (1.2.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the first release from the VDR and DVB Packaging Team
  <pkg-vdr-dvb-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  Many thanks to Tobias Grimm and Thomas GÃ¼nther for the various improvements
  of the package.

  In this Release, we changed the path of the conf-files to /var/lib/vdr,
  static conf-files will still be under /etc/vdr, and symlinked to
  /var/lib/vdr. 
  If you already have non-static files (channels.conf, remote.conf, 
  setup.conf and timers.conf), these files will be moved by the 
  postinst-script to /var/lib/vdr.

  The most important change in this release is the new init-system of vdr,
  which was taken from c't-vdr, a woody-based distribution, optimized for vdr.
    - Plugins are no longer loaded via /etc/default/vdr. Instead of this,
      every installed plugin will be loaded automatically. The order of the
      plugins can be configured via /etc/vdr/plugins/order.conf.
    - The commands.conf and the reccmds.conf files will be auto-generated 
      by the init-script for better integration of vdr-addons.
      If you already have a commands.conf or reccmds.conf, you should move it
      to /etc/vdr/command-hooks/{commands|reccmds}.custom.conf .
