To build, run these two commands:
  ./configure
  make

Your user must be in /etc/sudoers for some of the build to work.
A line like this must be inserted if you are not in there yet:
youruser ALL=(ALL) ALL

The build is unlikely to work if you are logged in as root.

Also, the build will only work on an existing LinuxMCE install and
so far has only been tested on LinuxMCE 0710 installed from the DVD.

As of May 5, 2008 - All major components build. CD/DVD Image building needs
to be worked on.

If you wish to rebuild a component that is normally only built once,
like MakeRelease, you can delete the appropriate state_XXX file in
the build directory. The build directory is also where debs and other
output is deposited during the build process.
