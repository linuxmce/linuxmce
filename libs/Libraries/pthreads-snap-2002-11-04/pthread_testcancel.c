      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function creates a deferred cancellation point
      *      in the calling thread. The call has no effect if the
      *      current cancelability state is

      *
      *      NOTES:
      *      1)      Cancellation is asynchronous. Use pthread_join
      *              to wait for termination of thread if necessary
