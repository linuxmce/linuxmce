/*! \mainpage EnOcean Port
This library is enables communication with the EnOcean Evaluation Board (105). It does all the work for you, like opening the serial port, sending data, receiving data and closing the connection in the end.
For the serial communication cssl is used (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cssl/).
This manual is divided in the following sections:
- \subpage intro
- \subpage advanced "Advanced usage"
- \subpage licence "Licence"
*/
//-----------------------------------------------------------
/*! \page intro Introduction
The library is written in C, so it should be useable on any platform where a C-compiler
is available. Nevertheless, up to now the library has only been tested under
Linux and MacOS.

To use this library, you only have to include the supplied header-files, you want to
use. For the basic usage, including EnOceanPort.h should be enough. If you want
to use the definitions and functions for the TCM120 module too, please include
TCM120.h too.
Inside this package you can also find the demo-program EnOceanPortTest.c, which should
give you some idea of how to use this library. If you want to have more insight, you
probably want to examine the code of the also available basic-GUI which is called
enoceanportbasicgui. If you have understood this pice of code, there should be no
open questions ;).

Now you can proceed to the \ref advanced "advanced section".
*/
//-----------------------------------------------------------
/*! \page advanced Advanced Usage
Well, the most important things have been mentioned in the \ref intro. Summarized:
Examine the code of the demo program and read the documentation of the available
functions. It should be no big deal to use this library.

But to make this section useful for you, I will give you the basic sequence of functions
which might be necessary to so something useful with the library:
First, call the \ref enocean_init function to open the port and examine the returned
\ref enocean_error_structure, if some error was returned. If everything went fine, proceed
with setting the callback-function which will be called if a frame was received. Use
the function \ref enocean_set_callback_function to do this. If you use the TCM120-module in the
EVA-board, feel free to construct some commands with the functions described in
\ref TCM120_functions and send the constructed \ref enocean_data_structure with the
\ref enocean_send command.

For a simple output of the received data frame, you can use the function
\ref enocean_printhex of \ref enocean_gethex in your callback-function.

After the job is done, you should call the \ref enocean_cleanup function to close the port
and free all unnecessary things.

Since this is everything the library is aware of, it is a good point for me to
stop here.
